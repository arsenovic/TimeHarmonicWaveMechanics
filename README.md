Abstract--- This paper presents an approach to special relativity which is more in line with electrical engineering, namely as the time-harmonic analysis of a linear system. The approach is derived from Hestenes' Zitter model for the electron[#hestenes_zitterbewegung_2020, #hestenes_quantum_2020], which assumes an internal structure of a light-like helix in spacetime. A time-harmonic model is constructed and combined with classical physical arguments to produce several fundamental multivector equations. In addition, the grade (dimension) of the quantities involved match their units. The Zitter model is then extended to a nested helix, as suggested by Consa[#consa_helical_2018], and attempts are made to derive the fine structure constant, and vacuum constants \mu_{0} and \epsilon_{0}. Since the models presented are based on a classical physics, they are 'local hidden-variable' theories which are not consistent with Bell's theorem.
